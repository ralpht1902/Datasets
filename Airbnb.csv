The rules serve to protect you as a guest by helping ensure that the environment you find here is the one that I intended to create. Please keep in mind:  You will be sharing common areas with other guests or residents, and thus the cleanliness of the common areas is far more dependent upon all guests cleaning up after themselves, than it is upon my once a week cleaning. Most guests do very well in keeping common areas clean! House rules: Please do not drag luggage up the front stairs. Please leave things as they are in your room: do not remove pictures from walls, don't move furniture around, and do not remove mattress protector from the mattress.
